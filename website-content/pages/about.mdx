AI Disrupt Summit is an inclusive, community-driven event for Western Australia’s growing AI and technology ecosystem. Our goal is to create 
an approachable, hands-on summit that brings together engineers, founders, researchers, students, and curious newcomers — especially those 
who may not normally get the opportunity to attend or contribute to AI-focused events.

As a satellite event of West Tech Fest, AI Disrupt Summit is proudly organised by Build Club Perth in partnership with Bloom and Curtin 
Entrepreneurs, with a shared mission to make advanced technology accessible, practical, and community-powered.

We achieve this by:
- Designing a program focused on building, not talking — workshops, demos, and real projects
- Keeping the event affordable and open to all experience levels
- Running the summit on a Saturday to improve accessibility
- Welcoming speakers and contributors from diverse technical and non-technical backgrounds
- Creating a safe, inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome to learn, test ideas, and collaborate
- Showcasing local AI startups, tools, and use cases that are relevant to WA's innovation landscape

## Why "AI Disrupt"?

Our name reflects our mission: empowering people who are building the future, not waiting for it.
The summit highlights the tools, agents, startups, and breakthroughs that are reshaping how we work — and gives attendees the space to experiment with them directly.

AI Disrupt Summit isn’t just for researchers or professional engineers; it’s for anyone interested in understanding, applying, or collaborating on intelligent technologies.
